*App running live at:* **[hortfrancis.github.io/array-reflection](https://hortfrancis.github.io/array-reflection/)**

This project was created while studying on the [Scion Coalition Scheme](https://www.netmatters.co.uk/train-for-a-career-in-tech) with Netmatters in October 2023. 

It is a front-end web application that: 
- Fetches an image from the [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/developers)
- Allows the user to save an email address
- Allows the user to assign an image from the Unsplash API to the currently selected email address

Multiple email addresses can be saved and later selected using a drop-down menu. Images already assigned will be retrieved and displayed on the page.
